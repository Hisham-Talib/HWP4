      Islam is one of the three Monothiestic Abrahamic religions, they believe that there is one God named "ﷲ" or "Allāhᵃ" which is derived by the two word of "Al-Ila" which means "The God". Muslims and people who study the Quran and Islam know that Allah is only one, he has no Son, Daughter, Monther, Father, Sister, Brother, Aunt, or any family for he is the all-mighty. And we believe that out of all the prophets in this world that lived from Adam to Moses to Jesus [Peace be upon them], Muhammad (ﷺ) is the last messenger/prophet that Allah has sent to this world. In which he brought the revelation of the Holy Qur'an and the Shari'a Law, which in simplistic terms is basically a new law that was brought to this world after the Law of Moses.
